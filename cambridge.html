        <p>A grave irregularity has disturbed the frosted calm of the University this Michaelmas, where certain undergraduates of a prominent College are alleged to have obtained unlawful assistance in the recent Christmas Tripos by recourse to the Aethernet.</p>

        <p>The paper in question—an examination in Ancient Physics, Philology and Miscellaneous Torments—contained, among other matters, a problem touching the smallest units of speech and a curious enquiry into a room of seven letters wherein “weary heads repair.”</p>

        <p>Several candidates, hitherto celebrated chiefly for their inability to repair anywhere on time, submitted answers of such crystalline correctness that the Examiners were compelled to make enquiries.</p>

        <p>It has now emerged that an ingenious student in possession of a contraband domestic cathode window had contrived to conceal the thin cathode ray tube within the lid of his writing desk.</p>

        <p>At a signal (the dropping of an inkstand), an accomplice in lodgings across the street consulted an Aetherworks “scholars’ compendium” and tapped the necessary hints back through the aether, where they appeared upon the underside of the candidate’s blotter in faint electric script.</p>

        <p>The device was discovered when a vigilant Proctor, suspecting mischief, demanded that the desk be removed, whereupon the wiring parted and the poor machine printed the answer in letters six inches high.</p>

        <p>The culprits have been sent down for the remainder of the term and required to copy out, one hundred times, the University’s newly appended statute: “That no Candidate shall, during Examination, communicate with the Aether, the Aetherworks, or any other Invisible Agency whatsoever, save his own Conscience.”</p>
