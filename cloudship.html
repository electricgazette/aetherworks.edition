        <p class="lede">A strange spectacle was observed yesterday above the Royal Dockyard, Portsmouth, when Captain Erasmus Lanyon, late of the Royal Engineers, caused to be launched his experimental Aerial Monitoring Balloon, or “Cloud-Ship.”</p>

        <p>Suspended beneath a modest envelope of hydrogen and propelled by a paddling apparatus reminiscent of a duck in distress, the craft succeeded in circling the harbour twice before alighting in a brewer’s yard.</p>

        <p>While certain naval authorities expressed doubt as to the martial value of a vessel that could be punctured by an indignant seagull, it was agreed that the overhead view of the anchorage was “most instructive.”</p>

        <p>A proposal that the Cloud-Ship be fitted with a small brass cannon was referred to a committee.</p>
