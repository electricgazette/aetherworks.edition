        <p>Operators at the Atlantic Cable Station have reported a most unusual occurrence. At intervals during the past fortnight, a faint but regular tapping has been observed upon the line, in no way corresponding to any message sent from either side.</p>

        <p>Mr. Edgar Pilbeam, Chief Electrician, at first presumed the disturbance to be the work of some playful crustacean. However, when the taps were transcribed upon a strip of paper and examined by Dr. Leverson, they were found to correspond to dots and dashes of the Morse code, spelling repeatedly the letters S – A – F – E.</p>

        <p>The possibility that the ocean itself is attempting to reassure us of its good intentions cannot be dismissed. Nevertheless, a diver has been ordered to examine the nearest section of cable, lest some rival power be conducting impertinent experiments at our expense. The Admiralty is reported to be listening with interest.</p>
