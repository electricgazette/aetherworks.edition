        <p class="lede">At Grim Ness, Orkney, a lighthouse has been fitted with an electro-phonic foghorn apparatus that astonishes mariners with its uncanny whispers.</p>

        <p>The contrivance, devised by Professor Altham, employs a resonant chamber and a vibrating diaphragm connected to the beacon’s lantern machinery. When fog descends, instead of the customary blast, a low murmur issues forth, carrying intelligible syllables across the waves.</p>

        <p>Fishermen report hearing admonitions such as “Steer to starboard” and “Mind the shoals,” delivered in tones both sepulchral and persuasive. Some declare the voice resembles that of the late Keeper, Mr. MacLeod, whose devotion to the light was proverbial.</p>

        <p>While certain authorities caution against reliance upon spectral counsel, others hail the invention as a humane improvement, sparing the ears of sailors from deafening horns and offering guidance in a gentler fashion.</p>

        <p>The Admiralty has dispatched a commission to determine whether the apparatus may be adopted more widely. Meanwhile, the Whispering Lighthouse continues to murmur its warnings, half mechanical, half mystical, to all who venture near Grim Ness.</p>
