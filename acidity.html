        <p class="lede">Professor Amelia Kersey, of the Chemical Section, has laid before the Fellows a dainty but most useful contrivance for the rapid testing of acidity and alkalinity in solutions and mixtures, whether domestic or diabolical.</p>

        <p>By steeping fine paper in extracts of certain vegetable dyes—among them the juice of red cabbage and the liquor of the litmus lichen—she has produced slips which, upon mere contact with a liquid, change their complexion according to its temper:</p>

        <p>Turning a modest crimson in acid company, and paling to blue when entertained by alkalies.</p>

        <p>In a demonstration that delighted the assembled savants, a series of household fluids—lemon-juice, soap-suds, vinegar, bicarbonate draughts, and even a suspect barrel of porter—were presented to the papers, which blushed or blanched with gratifying promptitude.</p>

        <p>“We may now ascertain, in the very scullery itself,” Professor Kersey declared, “whether a mixture tends to bite like a lawyer or soothe like a curate.”</p>

        <p>Apothecaries foresee a brisk trade; and certain matrons have already petitioned the Professor to adapt the method to detect the moral acidity of visiting relatives. This, she regrets, must await future research.</p>
