      <h1>An Automaton Clerk for the Counting-House</h1>
      <p class="byline">Dispatch from our Industrial Correspondent • London</p>

      <p class="lede">
        In the bustling offices of the City, where ledgers groan beneath the weight of commerce,
        there has appeared a mechanical clerk whose brass wheels and pump handle promise to relieve
        the weary bookkeeper of his endless arithmetic.

        The device, styled as a Clerk-Engine, is furnished with a series of cogwheels, pistons, and
        a polished crank. When set in motion, it performs addition and subtraction with a fidelity
        that astonishes even the most skeptical of accountants. Figures are entered upon a dial,
        and the result appears upon a rotating drum, neatly inscribed by a stylus of hardened steel.

        Witnesses report that the machine, once engaged, ticks with a rhythm not unlike the beating
        of a sober heart, and its outputs are so precise that even the auditors of the Crown have
        expressed admiration. The Clerk-Engine is said to reduce the labors of a day to the span of
        an hour, and to do so without complaint, fatigue, or the temptation of a public house.

          The inventor, Mr. Hargreaves, assures us that the device may be adapted to calculate
          interest, tally inventories, and even prepare invoices. Thus the counting-house may soon
          be staffed not by clerks of flesh and blood, but by clerks of brass and steam.

        Whether this marvel shall replace the human clerk entirely remains to be seen. Yet it is
        certain that the Automaton Clerk marks a new chapter in the annals of industry, where
        machinery not only spins and hammers, but also thinks—or at least calculates—with a
        precision that rivals the human mind.
