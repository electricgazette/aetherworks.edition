      <p><strong>Stolen Diamonds Recovered by Means of a Photographic Shadow</strong></p>
      <p><em>Cape Town, Cape Colony</em></p>

      <p class="lede">A daring robbery of unset diamonds from the counting-house of Messrs. Van Der Merwe & Sons has been brought to a satisfactory conclusion by the ingenuity of Inspector Harrington of the Colonial Police.</p>

      <p>It appears that a camera had been left upon its tripod near the safe, prepared for the idle amusement of the clerks. While the apparatus was not intentionally discharged during the crime, the lens, having been exposed to strong sunlight, produced a faint image upon the plate nonetheless. When developed, the photograph yielded little more than a blur and a curious elongated shadow.</p>

      <p>Dr. Reuleaux, who happened to be travelling through the Colony in search of “sun-perforated hieroglyphs,” was consulted. By comparing the distorted shadow with the silhouettes of every clerk when back-lit by a gas jet, he identified one Mr. Abel Sykes as the only man whose hat, nose, and regrettable whiskers could cast so singular a profile. Confronted with this scientific evidence, Sykes confessed at once.</p>

      <p>It is expected that cameras will now be admitted as credible witnesses in certain colonies, though wigs and gowns are not yet contemplated for them.</p>
