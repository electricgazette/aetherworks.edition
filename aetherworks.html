      <div class="columns">
        <p class="lede">The world to-day stands upon the very brink of a new and astonishing convenience. Mr. Basil Fenwick Wexley, Esq., together with Dr. P. C. R. Reuleaux and Dr. F. X. Leverson, has this week laid before a select committee of the Royal Society a contrivance so extraordinary that certain older Fellows were observed to clutch their wigs in visible alarm.</p>

        <p>The invention, modestly styled the Aetherworks, is described as “a system of electric conveyance whereby letters, diagrams, and even photographic likenesses may be flashed, as it were, through the very substance of the aether to any parlour in the civilized world.”</p>

        <p>At the heart of the arrangement lies a device termed the Remarkably Thin Cathode Ray Tube—a sheet of glass scarcely thicker than a gentleman’s visiting card, yet capable, by the agency of unseen rays, of calling forth upon its face legible characters and images in points of greenish light.</p>

        <p>“The common newspaper,” observed Dr. Leverson in his lecture, “has hitherto relied upon ink, paper, and the breakfast table. We now look to a day when a subscriber in Bombay or Toronto, by the mere turning of a tap and the warming of a coil, may behold this very column spring into being upon his drawing-room wall.”</p>

        <p>In the demonstration performed before the assembled savants, a short paragraph from The Electric Gazette was traced upon a special key-board, converted into impulses of electricity, and dispatched by wire to a companion apparatus in an adjoining chamber. There, before the astonished gaze of the committee, the same words appeared at once upon the glass, formed by a dancing beam so nimble that the eye perceived only a steady script.</p>

        <p>Even more remarkable, a small daguerreotype of Her Majesty’s profile, duly scanned by Reuleaux’s mechanical fingers, was reproduced at a distance in a ghostly but recognisable likeness.</p>

        <p>Certain clergymen present expressed some doubt as to whether such traffic in the aether might not unduly disturb the angels. Mr. Wexley replied that the angels, being orderly beings, would undoubtedly welcome the improved legibility of our handwriting.</p>

        <p>Should this Aetherworks achieve commercial success, we are credibly informed that The Electric Gazette will be amongst the first to furnish its subscribers with an “Evening Edition by Aether.” Those who prefer the rustle of paper to the hum of coils may rest assured that no respectable breakfast table shall be abandoned without a struggle.</p>
