        <p>Residents of this noble city have grown accustomed to wonders, yet even they paused in their carriage rides upon the Maidan yesterday to stare at a beast the like of which no menagerie has ever exhibited.</p>

        <p>The creation, known locally as the Steam Elephant, is the brain-child of one Mr. Chandrasekhar Mukherji, Engineer, under license from a Liverpool firm.</p>

        <p>Standing twelve feet at the shoulder, fashioned of riveted iron plates cunningly painted in imitation of hide, and propelled by a small but spirited boiler concealed in its belly, the Elephant is capable of drawing two tram-cars at a walking pace while emitting the occasional triumphant whistle.</p>

        <p>Its trunk, composed of jointed segments, may be raised in salutation and is rumoured to be able to dispense tea.</p>

        <p>Mr. Mukherji proposes lines of such beasts to convey both freight and passengers through the bazaar without recourse to coal-dust or the odours of inferior horseflesh.</p>

        <p>Hindu religious authorities, after some deliberation, have agreed that since the creature is made chiefly of steel, no insult is intended to the animal kingdom.</p>
