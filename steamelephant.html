      <p><strong>Indo-British Engineering Marvel Astounds the Maidan</strong></p>
      <p><em>Special Correspondence of the Electric Gazette<br />Calcutta, December 6</em></p>

      <p class="lede">Residents of this noble city have grown accustomed to wonders, yet even they paused in their carriage rides upon the Maidan yesterday to stare at a beast the like of which no menagerie has ever exhibited. The creation, known locally as the Steam Elephant, is the brain-child of one Mr. Chandrasekhar Mukherji, Engineer, under license from a Liverpool firm.</p>

      <p>Standing twelve feet at the shoulder, fashioned of riveted iron plates cunningly painted in imitation of hide, and propelled by a small but spirited boiler concealed in its belly, the Elephant is capable of drawing two tram-cars at a walking pace while emitting the occasional triumphant whistle. Its trunk, composed of jointed segments, may be raised in salutation and is rumoured to be able to dispense tea.</p>

      <p>Mr. Mukherji proposes lines of such beasts to convey both freight and passengers through the bazaar without recourse to coal-dust or the odours of inferior horseflesh. Hindu religious authorities, after some deliberation, have agreed that since the creature is made chiefly of steel, no insult is intended to the animal kingdom.</p>
