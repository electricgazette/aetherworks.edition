        <p>A large marine chronometer, destined for the use of a steam-packet, has lately given evidence in a case of petty larceny with a precision that would do credit to Solomon.</p>

        <p>The instrument, being wound daily at noon, was found one morning to have stopped at exactly twenty-three minutes past two. When the warehouse was later discovered to have been entered by stealth during the night, suspicion fell upon various persons. However, Dr. Baxter-Smyth, summoned to advise upon the mechanism, observed that the watch could not have ceased of its own accord, but must have been jarred by a rough handling at that exact minute.</p>

        <p>Consulting the railway timetables, the Inspector concluded that only one man—an ex-porter known to favour the 2:40 a.m. train—could have quitted the district in time. The culprit was arrested upon his arrival in Manchester; the missing goods were found in his trunk, together with a pamphlet on the importance of punctuality.</p>

        <p>The chronometer, having thus vindicated itself, has been restored to its original duty of keeping the ship to her course and the officers to their watches.</p>
