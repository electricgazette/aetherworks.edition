      <p><strong>Chronometer in Liverpool Warehouse Denounces a Thief</strong></p>
      <p><em>Liverpool Docks</em></p>

      <p>A large marine chronometer, destined for the use of a steam-packet, has lately given evidence in a case of petty larceny with a precision that would do credit to Solomon.</p>

      <p>The instrument, being wound daily at noon, was found one morning to have stopped at exactly twenty-three minutes past two. When the warehouse was later discovered to have been entered by stealth during the night, suspicion fell upon various persons. However, Dr. Reuleaux, summoned to advise upon the mechanism, observed that the watch could not have ceased of its own accord, but must have been jarred by a rough handling at that exact minute.</p>

      <p>Consulting the railway timetables, the Inspector concluded that only one man—an ex-porter known to favour the 2:40 a.m. train—could have quitted the district in time. The culprit was arrested upon his arrival in Manchester; the missing goods were found in his trunk, together with a pamphlet on the importance of punctuality.</p>

      <p>The chronometer, having thus vindicated itself, has been restored to its original duty of keeping the ship to her course and the officers to their watches.</p>
