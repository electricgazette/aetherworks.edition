        It is with no small astonishment that we lay before our readers an image of the midnight
        heaven, caught and made steadfast by the latest contrivance of that esteemed manufacturer,
        Vigenere—whose celebrated instruments for the Camera Obscura and the Cryptographic Engine
        alike have advanced both the pursuits of the gentleman and the safeguards of the Empire.

        The apparatus, newly contrived and handsomely appointed in brass and blackened steel, does
        not merely accept the meek testimony of starlight: it woos it, conducts it, and causes it to
        confess itself upon the prepared plate with a fidelity hitherto unknown to mortal endeavor.
        By delicate gearing and a clockwork equatorial mount, the heavens are tracked with a grace
        so judicious that the stars, those ancient witnesses, appear as pin-pricks of immaculate
        silver, each fixed as though a jeweller had set them by hand upon velvet night.

        The Operator, trained in the sober methods recommended by Vigenere’s Manual of Photographic
        Perfections, achieves his result by adjustments almost priestly in their solemnity:
        aperture confessed, exposure ordained, focus sealed with a whisper. Presently, the plate is
        bathed and summoned from its dark baptism, whereupon the firmament, as if grateful for the
        ceremony, yields its figure—its constellations, its uncertainties, its mute splendours—into
        mortal custody.
