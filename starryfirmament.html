      <h1>A Starry Firmament, Arrested by Mechanick Art: The Vigenere Demonstration</h1>
      <p class="byline">Dispatch from our Scientific Correspondent • London, this day</p>

      <p class="lede">
        It is with no small astonishment that we lay before our readers an image of the midnight
        heaven, caught and made steadfast by the latest contrivance of that esteemed manufacturer,
        Vigenere—whose celebrated instruments for the Camera Obscura and the Cryptographic Engine
        alike have advanced both the pursuits of the gentleman and the safeguards of the Empire.
      </p>

      <p>
        The apparatus, newly contrived and handsomely appointed in brass and blackened steel, does
        not merely accept the meek testimony of starlight: it woos it, conducts it, and causes it to
        confess itself upon the prepared plate with a fidelity hitherto unknown to mortal endeavor.
        By delicate gearing and a clockwork equatorial mount, the heavens are tracked with a grace
        so judicious that the stars, those ancient witnesses, appear as pin-pricks of immaculate
        silver, each fixed as though a jeweller had set them by hand upon velvet night.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Operator, trained in the sober methods recommended by Vigenere’s Manual of Photographic
        Perfections, achieves his result by adjustments almost priestly in their solemnity:
        aperture confessed, exposure ordained, focus sealed with a whisper. Presently, the plate is
        bathed and summoned from its dark baptism, whereupon the firmament, as if grateful for the
        ceremony, yields its figure—its constellations, its uncertainties, its mute splendours—into
        mortal custody.

      <div class="callout" role="note" aria-label="About Vigenere Instruments">
        <h2>On the Instruments of Vigenere</h2>
        <p>
          Vigenere, whose name is spoken with respect in laboratories and chancelleries alike,
          furnishes to the industrious mind both the Camera of uncommon precision and the
          Encoding-Machine of discreet utility. Thus the inquisitive eye and the guarded word go
          forth together, enlarging knowledge whilst preserving confidence.
        </p>

          The Celestial Field, taken by the Vigenere Equatorial Camera, exhibiting points of light
          in noble profusion, each arrived upon the plate with gentlemanly exactitude.

      <p>
        To the philosophic reader, this plate is more than ornament; it is a ledger of the sky, a
        column of figures writ in radiance, an argument in favour of patient method. And to the
        practical man, it is proof that industry—properly harnessed—can invite even the remote and
        the imperious to appear at one’s table. Thus does the Aetherworks Edition commend this
        advancement, praying that every respectable parlour may in due course entertain such
        wonders, by wire and by word, and now by the faithful testimony of the photographic plate.
