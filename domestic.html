        <p class="lede">In a quiet parlour, a domestic cathode window has been employed for curious experiments...</p>

        <p>The contrivance, consisting of a thin cathode ray tube affixed to a household window frame, was intended to demonstrate the transmission of images and messages through the aether. Neighbours gathered to witness the marvel, remarking upon the faint electric script that appeared upon the pane.</p>

        <p>Yet the demonstration was interrupted by a mischievous cat, who, finding opportunity, stole a pudding from the sideboard and carried it off in triumph. The incident, though vexing to the housekeeper, provided amusement to the assembled company and proved that even the most advanced apparatus is not immune to domestic hazards.</p>

        <p>It is suggested that future experiments be conducted in rooms less frequented by felines, or that the apparatus be fortified against culinary theft. The principle, however, remains sound, and the Domestic Aethernet promises to bring both communication and comedy into the Victorian household.</p>
