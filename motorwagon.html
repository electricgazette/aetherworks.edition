        <p>In a development which may yet prove as significant as the first perambulations of Mr. Benz’s petrol carriage, German engineer Herr Ferdinand Möbius (a distant cousin, we are told, of the renowned geometer of the same name) has presented to the Leipzig Society for Useful Mechanics a design for an Electric Motor-Wagon.</p>

        <p>Rejecting the clatter and effluvia of the internal combustion engine, Herr Möbius proposes a carriage propelled by a fine electric motor, drawing its power from a bank of accumulators secreted beneath the floor. By a system of cleverly wound coils and permanent magnets, the motor exerts a steady turning force upon the axle, without recourse to pistons, explosions, or smells.</p>

        <p>“The age of the detonating carriage,” declared the inventor, “is but an unfortunate parenthesis. The future rolls upon silent wheels.”</p>

        <p>In his demonstration model, a small wagon silently traversed the hall, bearing three stout professors and a table of refreshments. The only audible sound was the clinking of glasses.</p>

        <p>Critics have objected that electric accumulators are heavy, costly, and reluctant to climb hills unaided. Herr Möbius cheerfully agrees, but contends that improvements in battery chemistry—and the establishment of public charging-posts supplied by municipal dynamos—will soon render the difficulty trivial.</p>

        <p>London cabmen, upon hearing of the invention, expressed grave suspicion of any vehicle that did not announce its approach with a proper racket. More visionary spirits, however, imagine a day when the streets may be traversed by wagons of such quiet dignity that one could, in theory, read The Electric Gazette from cover to cover while gliding from Paddington to the Bank, disturbed only by the occasional scream of a pedestrian.</p>

        <p>The Society will watch with keen interest to see whether Herr Möbius’s motor-wagon proves to be a line of practical progress, or, like its namesake strip, an ingenious contrivance that returns perpetually upon itself.</p>
